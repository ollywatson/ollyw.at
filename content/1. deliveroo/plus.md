# Redefining the Deliveroo Plus brand and proposition

![I ran a series of product strategy projects focused on expanding the Deliveroo Plus offering, leading to the creation of a new pricing tier and a number of new member benefits. I conducted workshops, design sessions and user research to help define the overall direction of the Plus program.](/plus-1.png)

![The addition of several new benefits demanded a new sign up page, which I refined through thorough user testing. When this launched, it caused a 7.85% increase in signups, with an estimated impact of Â£1.9m additional revenue per year.](/plus-2.png)

![After expanding the proposition, Plus was due a rebrand. I worked closely with our in-house brand team, and crafted a new logo and iconography with custom type.](/plus-3.png)

![This work led to a series of large scale video ad campaigns launched in 2024.](/plus-4.jpg)
