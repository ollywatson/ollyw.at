# Making Deliveroo a more flexible and convenient ordering app

![I led the design of a new feature in the Deliveroo app, which allows customers to store and retrieve multiple baskets.

I noticed several icons gaining more visibility as projects like this one progressed, and decided they needed a refresh to perform well in the UI. As a leading contributor to Deliveroo's icon set, I created updated icons and had them approved and added to the product.](/multi-basket-3.png)
